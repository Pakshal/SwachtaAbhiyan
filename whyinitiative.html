        <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Sacred Shatrunjay Teerth: A Call for Awareness and Action During the Fagan Pheri Journey</h2>
        <p class="lead">Before the Fagan Pheri journey begins, awareness is crucial. In March 2024, a group of students from Tapovan Sanskar Peeth, Shatrunjay Youth Mandal, and children from Lok Bharati School, under their NSS program, gathered to clean and purify places like Giriraj, Chandran Talavdi, and others on the Shatrunjay hills during Fagan Sudhi Teras and Fagan Sudhi Chauth. They collected about <b>100 large bags</b> of garbage. The forest department also supported this sacred work. However, shocking discoveries were made related to the Fagan Ferry journey that are damaging the Shatrunjay Teerth.

        <br><br>
        Shocking Discoveries: Vendors in Palitana set up food and drink stalls during the Fagan Pheri journey. These stalls sell items like water bottles, juice, sugarcane juice, and snacks in plastic plates, cups, and bottles. Pilgrims (our Jain brothers and sisters) buy these items and then discard the used plastic on the hills. This has become a major issue during the Fagan Ferry journey.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Impact of the above</h2>
        <p class="lead">
        Sacredness of Shatrunjay:
        We don’t eat or drink in temples because temples are sacred spaces for worship, not for eating. Similarly, the entire Giriraj hill is sacred, as mentioned in Shatrunjay Mahatma. What is not allowed in temples should not be done on Shatrunjay hills either. Therefore, eating or drinking during the pilgrimage, including the Fagan Ferry journey, is forbidden. Water fountains are provided by the temple authorities for those who are thirsty, but food and drink should not be consumed.
        <br>
        <br>
        Pilgrims' Struggles:
        Food stalls tempt hungry and thirsty pilgrims along the journey. Vendors send items up in advance, leading to some pilgrims consuming food on the hill. This behavior pollutes the area and tarnishes the image of those visiting for spiritual purposes.
        <br>
        <br>
        Impact on Pilgrims’ Fast:
        The 38-kilometer journey is often a fast for many pilgrims, but food stalls along the way weaken their resolve, causing them to break their fast and disrupt the spiritual discipline of the pilgrimage.
        <br>
        <br>
        Waste Generation:
        Eating at these stalls generates massive waste, polluting the environment. The resulting trash harms Shatrunjay Teerth and undermines the true purpose of the pilgrimage—seeking blessings, not contributing to pollution.
        <br>
        <br>
        Carrying Food and Drinks:
        Even bringing food or drinks from home leads to others consuming it, perpetuating the cycle of waste and environmental harm, especially as people dispose of trash irresponsibly along the journey.
        <br>
        <br>
        Plastic Pollution:
        Plastic waste, including bottles, plates, and spoons, takes centuries to decompose. The harmful impact of plastic on Shatrunjay Teerth is irreversible, polluting the land and its ecosystem for future generations.
        <br>
        <br>
        Wildlife Threats:
        Plastic waste poses a significant threat to wildlife, as animals may ingest or become entangled in it. This endangers both the environment and animals, causing fatal harm.
        <br>
        <br>
        Risk of Restrictions:
        If the pollution continues, the Forest Department may impose restrictions on pilgrim access to Shatrunjay. It’s our responsibility to preserve the environment to avoid such measures.

Their tireless work and devotion have made a significant difference in preserving the purity of Shatrunjay. Without their efforts, these vital locations on the hills would have been left in a deteriorating condition.
